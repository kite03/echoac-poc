## Background
echo.ac is a commercial "screensharing tool", marketed and developed mostly for the Minecraft PvP community, but also used by some other game communities, such as Rust.
A "screensharing tool" is a program developed to "assist" server admins in identifying if someone's using cheats or similar banned external tools ingame - As such, these programs execute numerous intrusive scans on users computer, while being very vague of what they data collect and why.

Echo refused to acknowledge this bug when contact was made.

Thanks for your time ðŸ’œ.
